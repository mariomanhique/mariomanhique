         <h1>Hi there</h1>
        <p>
          I am Mario Ernesto Manhique, self-taught Android Developer with 2+ years of hands-on experience in crafting Android
          mobile applications using Kotlin. My expertise includes a robust grasp of modern
          techniques such as Jetpack Compose, as well as proficiency in implementing design patterns like
          MVVM and MVP. I am well-versed in developing with a Multi-Modular Architecture, and I excel in
          seamlessly integrating third-party APIs, with a particular focus on leveraging Retrofit for optimal
          performance.
